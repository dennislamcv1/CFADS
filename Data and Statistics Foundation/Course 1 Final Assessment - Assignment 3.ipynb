    "You now want do calculate the confidence interval for large funds based on the sample of 50 that you have used so far. As the DOSM, which is the basis of sampling theory, makes certain assumptions about the population distribution you decide that you first want to visualise what the sample distribution looks like. You therefore want to produce a histogram of the sample's returns. The relevant data is on the excel spreadsheet called 'Course 1 Final Assessment', sheet name 'Big50' and column headed \"Return\". You decide to use matplotlib.pyplot to creat a histogram and decide that ten bins should provide enough detail. Please write the suitable code in the cell below. "
