This data is in an xlsx spreadsheet called 'Course 1 Final Assessment' and the sheet named 'SectorX'. The sectors are in a column headed 'Sector' and their relative frequency is the a column headed 'Big50'. Once you have produced the pie chart it needs to be saved so that it can be included in your report. Please 'save image as' by right clicking on the image."
