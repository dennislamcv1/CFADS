## Data Science for Investment Professionals Specialization
### About this Specialization


This Specialization is uniquely tailored to the needs of investment professionals or those with investment industry knowledge who want to develop a basic, practical understanding of machine learning techniques and how they are used in the investment process. Through the three courses, you will learn techniques for presenting data and importance of the “data story”, produce data visualizations using Python, assess and apply probability concepts to investing scenarios, compare simple time-series models and understand their limitations, discover how machine learning applications can address investment problems, and understand how to apply the CFA Institute Ethical Decision-Making Framework to machine learning dilemmas. All that you learn in this Specialization will give you the knowledge and confidence to explain clearly and “translate” machine learning concepts and their application to real-world investment problems to a non-expert audience and clients. Check out this short video overview.
### Applied Learning Project

In the courses, learners will use Python to practice calculating measures of central tendency, calculating measures of dispersion, and creating data visualizations as well as see the application of Python in linear regressions and advanced regression concepts. Learners will also practice their communication skills and showcase their creativity in several peer review assignments.
